-docker run jessebot/onboardme:latest /bin/bash
+docker run jessebot/onboardme:latest

 To run the image locally with onbaordme installed but _not_ run:
 
 ```bash
 # best if you have your own dot files, or need a smaller initial docker image to pull
 # no packages outside of the required pre-reqs for onboardme have been installed
-docker run jessebot/onboardme:no-install /bin/bash
